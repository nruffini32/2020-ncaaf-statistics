# This project will collect team statistics for 2020 ncaaf teams and compare them to win/loss ratios
These numbers will continously update as the season continues

The goal is to see which team statistics correlate to a higher win/loss ratio

1. Run CreateDatabase.py to create the database ncaaf2020stats.db

2. Run CreateScatterPlots.py to create the visuals and calculate the correlation for each statistic compared to win/loss ratio
